# Recipes with friends

## Goals:
I'm always annoyed when I search for a new recipe and I have to scroll down for 3 minutes just to get down to the actual instructions. That's why I thought about building this app, where you and your friends can share your favourite recipes.

**The main targets for the app were:**
- Allow users to register and upload their recipes
- Recipes consist of the title, difficulty badge, instructions with the ability to format the text and an image
- Recipes can be viewed in one place, and each recipe can be accessed individually
- Recipes can be liked and commented on. Comments can also be liked. 
- Users can access the profiles of other users to preview all posts made by them


## Technologies used:
- JavaScript
- EJS templating language
- Mongo and Mongoose
- Node and Express

## Difficulties encountered
- ...
## What I've learnt

## Further improvements
- Lazy loading of recipes
- Styling improvements
- Improve registering process by adding new passport strategies
