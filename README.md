TO DO: 
FIGURE OUT HOW TO REDIRECT TO NEW USER IN AUTH.JS SO THE USER CAN REGISTER AND GO STRAIGHT TO THEIR NEW PROFILE

ON RECIPES PAGE LISTING, LINK TO PROFILE SHOULD TAKE YOU TO OTHER PEOPLE'S PROFILE I JUST NEED TO FIX THE SUBMISSION FORM WHICH SHOULD DISAPPEAR ON PROFILES THAT AREN'T OURS



homepage to have a carousel with the top rated products or at least manually selected top / most popular and the automatic pulling as a extra feature in the future

recipes page has to pull all the details: image, labels etc. 

sort header 

each user to have profile where you can preview their recipes 

maybe a profile pic? probably not.
