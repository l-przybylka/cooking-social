// goals:

you can browse reciepes as a guest 
you can register to add new posts, comment and like 

// techs used: 
JS,EJS,MONGOOSE,MONGO,EXPRESS,NODE

// nice to have:

// what I've learned



TO DO: 


each post needs to have it's own page:
likes aren't working for posts
styling: maybe similar to the profile, 2 columns and image on the left comments on the right but what about mobile?



homepage to have a carousel with the top rated products or at least manually selected top / most popular and the automatic pulling as a extra feature in the future

recipes page has to pull all the details: image, labels etc. 

comments and likes for each post

sort header 

each user to have profile where you can preview their recipes 

maybe a profile pic? probably not.
